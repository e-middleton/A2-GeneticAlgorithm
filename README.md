# A2 Genetic Algorithms

Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming. 

Group Members: NA

Any peers and/or TAs/Tutors you collaborated with: NA

Would you like to give "kudos" to anyone who was particularly supportive or helpful?

Cite any references used: Only class notes and javadoc

If you used AI, please describe how you used it and what the experience taught you: na


## Questions

Please briefly describe what you observed about the "winners" produced by your genetic algorithm. Did changing the parameter values have any effect on what you observed?

The winners had much longer chromosomes than the others, and they were usually two or three letters repeating like DADADADAD or ABCABCABCBA.

## Reflection

Please provide a reflection on your experience with this assignment-- what was interesting? what was hard? what do you feel like you learned?

It was neat, it felt really satisfying to be able to quickly write up a little game/simulation and have a pretty good idea of what's going on in 
the memory while it runs.
